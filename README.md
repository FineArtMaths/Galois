# Galois
A VST3 waveshaper based on simple mathematical operations.

TO DO LIST:
* Add filter controls
* Consider adding a switch to make it easier to use with guitar, or some other way to finely control the parameters.
* Consider adding modulation? This could make the GUI very complicated and can be automated in a DAW so maybe not.
* Factory presets
* Demo video
